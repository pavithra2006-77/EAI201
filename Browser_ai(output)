"Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass."

"It can be expressed with the equation F = ma, where F is the net force applied, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration produced."

"This law explains how the velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to external forces and is fundamental in classical mechanics."

Topic: Newton's Second Law

Descriptive Summary:
Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting upon it and inversely proportional to its mass.

It can be expressed with the equation F = ma, where F is the net force applied, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration produced.

This law explains how the velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to external forces and is fundamental in classical mechanics.
